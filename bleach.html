                <b><p>Ichigo Kurosaki is an ordinary high schooler—until his family is attacked by <br>
                    a Hollow, a corrupt spirit that seeks to devour human souls. It is then that he <br>
                    meets a Soul Reaper named Rukia Kuchiki, who gets injured while protecting Ichigo's <br>
                    family from the assailant. To save his family, Ichigo accepts Rukia's offer of taking <br>
                    her powers and becomes a Soul Reaper as a result. However, as Rukia is unable to regain <br>
                    her powers, Ichigo is given the daunting task of hunting down the Hollows that plague their <br>
                    town. However, he is not alone in his fight, as he is later joined by his friends—classmates <br>
                    Orihime Inoue, Yasutora Sado, and Uryuu Ishida—who each have their own unique abilities.<br>
                     As Ichigo and his comrades get used to their new duties and support each other on and off <br>
                     the battlefield, the young Soul Reaper soon learns that the Hollows are not the only real threat <br>
                     to the human world. [Written by MAL Rewrite]
