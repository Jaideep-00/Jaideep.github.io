                <b><p>Gold Roger was known as the "Pirate King," the strongest and most infamous being to have <br>
                    sailed the Grand Line. The capture and execution of Roger by the World Government brought a <br>
                    change throughout the world. His last words before his death revealed the existence of the <br>
                    greatest treasure in the world, One Piece. It was this revelation that brought about the Grand <br>
                    Age of Pirates, men who dreamed of finding One Piece—which promises an unlimited amount of riches <br>
                    and fame—and quite possibly the pinnacle of glory and the title of the Pirate King. Enter Monkey Luffy,<br>
                     a 17-year-old boy who defies your standard definition of a pirate. Rather than the popular persona of a <br>
                     wicked, hardened, toothless pirate ransacking villages for fun, Luffy's reason for being a pirate is one of <br>
                     pure wonder: the thought of an exciting adventure that leads him to intriguing people and ultimately, the <br>
                     promised treasure. Following in the footsteps of his childhood hero, Luffy and his crew travel across the <br>
                     Grand Line, experiencing crazy adventures, unveiling dark mysteries and battling strong enemies, all in order <br>
                     to reach the most coveted of all fortunes—One Piece. [Written by MAL Rewrite] </p>
